The “root” in this case may not be a real root word, but just a canonical form of the original word.

        "For example, in the context of a search system, if your search query is “what is text preprocessing?” , you want the search system to focus on surfacing documents that talk about text preprocessing over documents that talk about what is. This can be done by preventing all words from your stop word list from being analyzed. Stop words are commonly applied in search systems, text classification applications, topic modelling, topic extraction and others. In my experience, stop word removal, while effective in search and topic extraction systems, showed to be non-critical in classification systems. However, it does help reduce the number of features in consideration which helps keep your models decently sized. Here is an example of stop word removal in action. All stop words are replaced with a dummy character, W.\n"
